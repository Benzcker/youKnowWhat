# youKnowWhat

This is a game written in Python using Pygame. 

It's for learning vocabulary or something else, the good thing is, that you can set the questions yourself and organize them in modules and share them with your friends. The questions get selected randomly but get influenced by the amount of how often you got this question and how well you answered.
